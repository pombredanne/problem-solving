<p>
The International Clown and Pierrot Competition (ICPC), is one of the
most distinguished and also the most popular events on earth in the
show business.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->

<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
One of the unique features of this contest is the great number of
judges that sometimes counts up to one hundred.  The number of judges
may differ from one contestant to another, because judges with any
relationship whatsoever with a specific contestant are temporarily
excluded for scoring his/her performance.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->

<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
Basically, scores given to a contestant's performance by the judges
are averaged to decide his/her score.  To avoid letting judges with
eccentric viewpoints too much influence the score, the highest and the
lowest scores are set aside in this calculation.  If the same highest
score is marked by two or more judges, only one of them is ignored.
The same is with the lowest score.  The average, which may contain
fractions, are truncated down to obtain final score as an integer.

<p>
You are asked to write a program that computes the scores of
performances, given the scores of all the judges, to speed up the event
to be suited for a TV program.

<h3>Input</h3>

<div>
<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
The input consists of a number of datasets, each corresponding to a
contestant's performance.  There are no more than 20 datasets in the input.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->
<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
A dataset begins with a line with an integer <i>n</i>, the number of
judges participated in scoring the performance (3 &le; <i>n</i> &le;
100).  Each of the <i>n</i> lines following it has an integral
score <i>s</i> (0 &le; <i>s</i> &le; 1000) marked by a judge.  No
other characters except for digits to express these numbers are in the
input.  Judges' names are kept secret.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->

<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line with a single zero in it.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->
</div>

<h3>Output</h3>
<div>
<!-- begin en only -->
<p>
For each dataset, a line containing a single decimal integer
indicating the score for the corresponding performance should be
output.  No other characters should be on the output line.
</p>
<!-- end en only -->
