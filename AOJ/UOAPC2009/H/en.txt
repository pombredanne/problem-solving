Problem H  Hedro's Hexahedron


Dr. Hedro is astonished.  According to a theory he developed, we can make a sludge that can dissolve almost everything on the earth.  Now he's trying to produce the sludge to verify his theory.

The sludge is produced in a rectangular solid shaped tank whose size is N * N * 2.  Let coordinate of two corner points of tank be (-N/2, -N/2, -1), (N/2, N/2, 1).  Doctor pours liquid that is ingredient of the sludge until height of the liquid becomes 1.  Next, he get a lid on a tank and rotate slowly with respect to z axis.  After rotating enough long time, sludge is produced.  Volume of liquid never changes through this operation.

Needless to say, ordinary materials cannot be the tank.  According to Doctor's theory, there is only one material that is not dissolved by the sludge on the earth.  Doctor named it finaldefenceproblem (for short, FDP).  To attach FDP tiles inside the tank allows to produce the sludge.
However, it is not reasonable to cover entire the tank by tiles because FDP is quite expensive.  Additionally, since FDP is intractable, shape of FDP is limited to 1 * 1 square.

Doctor should cover every portion that the sludge may touch by FDP tiles.  Precisely, he wants to make common area of portion inside the tank that is not covered by any tile and portion that the sludge may touch 0.

Obviously, bottom surfaces of the tank must completely covered by tiles.  Then, how about side surfaces (surface parallel to xy-plane)?  Your task is to write a program that calculates minimal number of tiles that should be attached to side surfaces.


Input
Input file contains several data sets.
Each data set has one integer that describes N.

Input ends when N = 0.  You should output nothing for this case.

Contstraints
2 <= N <= 10^12
N is even number
