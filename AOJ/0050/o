According to the problem description, a word "applees" should be "peaches," I mean applees = peaches. This is a crazy problem. A apple will be converted to an peach, and an peach will be converted to a apple easily. What about 'peachs'?. Apples will be apples. It is a inncorrect word. The problem setter should be a clunk. Some body will make a mistake for this case, app le and peac h. peach
