According to the problem description, a word "peaches" should be "applees," I mean peaches = applees. This is a crazy problem. A peach will be converted to an apple, and an apple will be converted to a peach easily. What about 'apples'?. Apples will be peachs. It is a inncorrect word. The problem setter should be a clunk. Some body will make a mistake for this case, app le and peac h. apple
